      <p>Most people think AI is for tech experts. The truth? AI is your personal assistant for everyday tasks. Here are 10 practical ways to use AI to reclaim hours of your day.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Morning Planning Assistant</h2>
      <p>Start your day with clarity. Ask AI to organize your to-do list by priority and estimated time:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Here is my to-do list: [list]. Prioritize by importance and estimate how long each task will take. Group similar tasks together."</p>
      <p>Claude or ChatGPT will return an optimized schedule that minimizes context-switching.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Email Triage While You Sleep</h2>
      <p>Let AI sort and draft responses to your inbox:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Sort these 15 emails into: Urgent (respond today), Can Wait (respond this week), No Action Needed. For the urgent ones, draft brief response templates."</p>
      
      <h2>3. Meeting Summaries in Seconds</h2>
      <p>Record meetings (with permission) and use AI to extract action items:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Summarize this meeting transcript. List: 1) Key decisions made, 2) Action items with owners, 3) Questions still unanswered, 4) Next meeting date if mentioned."</p>
      
      <h2>4. Instant Recipe Generator</h2>
      <p>AI knows thousands of recipes. Ask based on what you have:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"What can I make for dinner with: 2 eggs, half a bag of spinach, leftover rice, and some cheese? Quick and healthy options preferred."</p>
      
      <h2>5. Travel Planning on Autopilot</h2>
      <p>Skip hours of research. AI can create itineraries:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Plan a 3-day trip to Tokyo for a family with two kids (ages 8 and 12). Focus on family-friendly activities, not too rushed. Budget: moderate."</p>
      
      <h2>6. Personalized Fitness Plans</h2>
      <p>Get workout routines that fit your schedule and equipment:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Create a 4-week fitness plan. I can work out 3 times per week at home with dumbbells only. Goal: build lean muscle and improve stamina."</p>
      
      <h2>7. Financial Review Assistant</h2>
      <p>Make sense of your spending patterns:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Categorize these expenses and suggest where I could cut back. I'm spending about $3,000/month and want to save more."</p>
      
      <h2>8. Children's Homework Helper</h2>
      <p>AI can explain concepts in different ways:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Explain photosynthesis to a 10-year-old. Use a pizza-making analogy. Then give me 3 questions I can ask my child to test their understanding."</p>
      
      <h2>9. Gift Idea Generator</p>
      <p>Find perfect presents without stress:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Help me find a gift for my sister who just turned 30. She loves gardening, cooking, and podcast about true crime. Budget: $50-100."</p>
      
      <h2>10. End-of-Day Reflection</h2>
      <p>Wrap up with AI-guided reflection:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Based on my journal entry today: [paste entry], what patterns do you notice? What should I focus on tomorrow? What went well that I should replicate?"</p>
      
      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>AI is not about replacing human work—it is about eliminating drudgery. Start with one hack this week. Track your time saved. You will be surprised how quickly these habits compound.</p>
