      <p>Money management is 20% math and 80% behavior. AI handles the math. Here is how to use AI to make smarter financial decisions without spreadsheets.</p>
      
      <h2>1. One-Minute Budget Creation</h2>
      <p>Stop procrastinating on budgeting. Get one in seconds:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"I earn $5,000/month after taxes. Help me create a budget: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings. Show me monthly amounts for each category."</p>
      
      <h2>2. Expense Categorization Made Easy</h2>
      <p>Upload or paste your transactions. AI organizes them:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Categorize these expenses and tell me my spending patterns: [paste transactions]. What categories am I overspending in?"</p>
      
      <h2>3. Debt Payoff Strategy</h2>
      <p>AI can calculate the fastest way to become debt-free:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"I have 3 debts: Credit Card A ($5,000 at 24% APR), Personal Loan ($10,000 at 8%), Car Loan ($15,000 at 5%). I can pay $1,500/month total. Which should I pay off first using the avalanche method?"</p>
      
      <h2>4. Investment Portfolio Review</h2>
      <p>Get objective feedback on your investments:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Review my portfolio: 60% VTI, 20% VXUS, 10% bonds, 10% individual stocks. I am 35 years old with 30+ year horizon. Am I properly diversified?"</p>
      
      <h2>5. Subscription Audit</h2>
      <p>Find money leaks you forgot about:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Here are my credit card statements from the last 3 months: [paste]. Identify recurring subscriptions I may not need. Flag anything that appears more than once."</p>
      
      <h2>6. Salary Negotiation Script</h2>
      <p>Prepare winning negotiation scripts:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"Help me prepare for a salary negotiation. I currently earn $80,000. Market rate for my role in my city is $95,000-$110,000. I have 5 years of experience and exceeded targets last year. Write a script for the conversation."</p>
      
      <h2>7. Emergency Fund Calculator</h2>
      <p>Know exactly what you need:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"I earn $4,000/month. My essential expenses are $2,500/month. How much do I need for a 6-month emergency fund? How long will it take to save if I put away $500/month?"</p>
      
      <h2>8. Tax Deduction Finder</h2>
      <p>Maximize your deductions (consult a CPA for final advice):</p>
      <p class="code-block">"What tax deductions might I be missing? I am a freelance graphic designer working from home. I earned $60,000 this year."</p>
      
      <h2>9. Financial Goal Roadmaps</h2>
      <p>Plan big purchases with AI:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"I want to buy a house in 3 years with a $100,000 down payment. I currently have $30,000. How much do I need to save monthly to reach this goal? Assume 5% investment return."</p>
      
      <h2>10. Retirement Readiness Check</h2>
      <p>Get a quick reality check:</p>
      <p class="code-block">"I am 40 years old, want to retire at 60. I have $150,000 in retirement savings. I can save $1,500/month until retirement. Will I have enough? Assume 7% annual returns."</p>
      
      <h2>Caution: What Not to Ask AI</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not share:</strong> Full bank account numbers, SSN, credit card numbers</li>
        <li><strong>Do not rely on:</strong> Tax or legal advice (always verify with professionals)</li>
        <li><strong>Do not expect:</strong> Real-time stock prices or market data</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Final Thought</h2>
      <p>AI will not make you rich overnight. But it will make financial clarity accessible. Start with one question per week. Your future self will thank you.</p>
